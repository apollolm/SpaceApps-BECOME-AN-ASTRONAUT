Become An Astronaut In Virtual Reality With Oculus VR For Space Apps Challenge
========

Hi All,

We are ambitious and crazy team of X-TECH, We are participating in NASA’s Space Apps Challenge 2nd time.

We choose to solve challenge PILOT A SATELLITE. We choose to go to the SPACE VIRTUAL REALITY and in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too. Just imagine that you can fly to space just having Oculus Rift VR tool, just imagine that you can watch to our beautiful HOME-Earth from different SATELLITES.

In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man’s history. We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a X-SPACE rocket, many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn, generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerators on the floor.

We are creating Virtual Reality Experience to Feel and Try all this great things!!!

Within these last 12 hours at least 100 satellites have circled the earth. Imagine that you can be in anyone of them, imagine that you can have a look from Windows of each one of them.

We have had our failures, but so have others, even if they do not admit them. And they may be less public.

To be sure, we are behind, and will be behind for some time in manned flight. But we do not intend to stay behind, and in this decade, we shall make up and move ahead.

The growth of our science and education will be enriched by new knowledge of our universe and environment, by new techniques of learning and mapping and observation.

And finally, the space effort itself, while still in its infancy, has already created a great number of new companies, and tens of thousands of new jobs. Space and related industries are generating new demands in investment and skilled personnel, and this city and this State, and this region, will share greatly in this growth. What was once the furthest outpost on the old frontier of the West will be the furthest outpost on the new frontier of science and space. Houston, your City of Houston, with its Manned Spacecraft Center, will become the heart of a large scientific and engineering community.

Well, space is there, and we’re going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God’s blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.

P.S. We inspired by words of great Entrepreneur – President John F. Kennedy and created Solution in 48 hours that COSTs you nothing to get that AMAZIGN Feeling of Astronaut. This is unique way to make people love SPACE and our home Earth.
